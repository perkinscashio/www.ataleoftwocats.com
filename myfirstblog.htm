My name is Perkins, and I'm the owner of two cats. Their names are Kitten, who's an eight-year old gray-and-white tabby with brown markings and a pink nose ; and Kitou, a four-month-old gray tabby with a brown nose and black lips.

As can be seen by the beforementioned age, Kitou (pronounced Kee-two) is a new addition to the family. She's a homeless and motherless stray that came to my front porch a week and a half ago, begging to be let inside the house.  It took me five days to let her come inside because I already have an indoor cat who's very territorial and who's free of fleas. I did not want a flea infestation in my house so I had to wait until I could get the little stray treated with flea medicine before I could let her come in.

<h2> &ldquo;A Green Tattoo on a Kitten's Belly???&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Last month, on Friday, November 15, 2024, I took her to a vet who's been around for many, many years&mdash;maybe 50 years?  This vet was a very sweet elderly gentleman who said the kitten would need to be spayed the following Tuesday.  So on Tuesday, I brought the kitten back in the morning.  When it was time for the kitten to come home, I received a phone call from them at around 3 p.m.   When I got there, the vet told me that he did NOT spay the kitten because of a green dot on her chest.  I thought to myself: what green dot? What on earth is that? Could it be cancer or what?  The vet said that the green dot means that she's already been spayed so there was no operation that day!  Why didn't he check her for that last Friday? That would have saved me time and money because taking a taxi cab is expensive! He also assured me that she's not pregnant, thank God! </p>

I took a look at her chest; sure enough, there was a linear green tattoo on her belly. What a relief! That sure saved me money on a spay procedure.

<h2>&ldquo;The Most Interesting Cat in the World&rdquo;</h2>

<p> This is Kitten. Yes, I know he's 8 years old, but his nickname has been Kitten for many years because he will always be my kitten!  As can be seen in the picture, he's a very suave and charming cat with a nice balance of sweetness and saltiness in his nature. Doesn't he kind of resemble Jonathan Goldsmith, a handsome and debonair actor who portrayed &ldquo;The Most Interesting Man in the World&rdquo; in a Dos Equis advertisement for beer?
